# OMP, vectorisation and CUDA galore!

Assignments for the Low-Level Parallel Programming course at Uppsala University.

## Prerequisite: Load dependencies on UPPMAX

If you are using the UPPMAX cluster that is provided by the course, run the
following command to load all dependencies.

```
$ source UPPMAX_modules.sh
```
This repo contains the solutions to four assignments, where the code for a crowd simulation is gradually parallelized with OPM, vectorized and finally upgraded to run on CUDA.
